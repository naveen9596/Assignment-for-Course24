Here's an assignment outline focused on practical skills with **Azure Storage Accounts** and **Azure SQL Database**. This assignment helps build understanding in provisioning, configuring, and working with these Azure services for cloud storage and database management.

### **Assignment: Azure Storage Account and Azure SQL Database**

#### **Objective**
The objective of this assignment is to:
1. Create and configure an Azure Storage Account.
2. Create an Azure SQL Database, perform basic operations, and set up secure access.
3. Understand data storage options, backup policies, and performance optimization.

### **Part 1: Azure Storage Account**

#### **Task 1: Create an Azure Storage Account**
1. **Provisioning**: 
   - Log in to the Azure portal.
   - Go to **Storage accounts** and create a new storage account.
   - Set the following:
     - **Resource Group**: Create a new resource group for the assignment.
     - **Storage Account Name**: Follow naming conventions (e.g., `myassignmentstorage`).
     - **Region**: Select a nearby region.
     - **Performance**: Choose `Standard` for cost-effective storage.
     - **Redundancy**: Set it to `Locally-redundant storage (LRS)` for simplicity.
   - Once done, review and create the storage account.

2. **Container Creation and Upload**
   - In your storage account, go to **Containers** and create a new container (e.g., `mycontainer`).
   - Set the public access level to `Private` for security.
   - Upload a few files to this container to simulate data storage.

3. **Access Management**
   - Generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) for the container and note the permissions it grants.
   - Provide access to the container using the SAS URL.
   - Validate access by using the URL in a browser or a REST client (like Postman).

4. **Blob Lifecycle Management**
   - Set up a **Lifecycle Management policy** to delete blobs that haven’t been accessed in 30 days.  
   - Describe the importance of lifecycle policies for cost optimization in your submission.

### **Part 2: Azure SQL Database**

#### **Task 1: Create an Azure SQL Database**
1. **Provisioning**:
   - Go to **SQL Databases** in the Azure portal.
   - Create a new SQL Database with the following:
     - **Resource Group**: Use the same resource group as above.
     - **Database Name**: Use a name like `myassignmentdb`.
     - **Server**: Create a new SQL Server, specifying a unique name, admin username, and password.
     - **Compute + Storage**: Choose `Basic` or `Standard` (S0) for testing purposes.
   - Once complete, verify that the database is created and accessible.

2. **Configure Database Security**
   - Enable **firewall rules** to allow specific IP addresses (your local IP for testing).
   - Enable **Azure Active Directory** authentication if available (optional, for advanced users).
   - Document the security configuration you’ve applied and why each setting is important.

3. **Table Creation and Data Insertion**
   - Connect to the SQL database using Azure Data Studio, SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), or the Azure Query Editor.
   - Create a sample table (`Employee`) with columns for `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Position`.
   - Insert sample data into the table.
   - Run a query to retrieve all rows from the table and include screenshots of the results.

4. **Backup and Restore**
   - Set up a **backup policy** for automated backups and explain its retention policy.
   - Simulate a database restore by creating a new database copy (restore to a point in time).
   - Document the steps and explain the importance of backups for data recovery.

---

### **Deliverables**

1. **Documentation**: A Word or PDF document including:
   - Screenshots for each step: provisioning, security configurations, table creation, and backup.
   - Brief descriptions of each step, explaining the purpose and settings chosen.
   - Reflections on the benefits and limitations of Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database.

2. **Code/SQL Queries**: 
   - Any SQL queries or scripts used for table creation and data insertion.
   - The SAS URL created for accessing the storage container.

3. **Discussion Questions**:
   - Describe how you would implement data security and compliance in an Azure SQL Database.
   - Discuss how lifecycle policies in Azure Storage can help reduce costs.
   - Explain the differences between Azure SQL Database’s backup options and how they support data recovery.

---

### **Evaluation Criteria**
- **Completeness**: Each task must be completed, with screenshots provided.
- **Accuracy**: Correct configurations and proper security settings.
- **Understanding**: Explanations for each step should demonstrate an understanding of storage and database services in Azure.
- **Security Best Practices**: Proper configuration of SAS tokens, firewall rules, and backup policies.

This assignment provides hands-on experience with Azure Storage and Azure SQL Database while reinforcing best practices for cloud storage and database management.
