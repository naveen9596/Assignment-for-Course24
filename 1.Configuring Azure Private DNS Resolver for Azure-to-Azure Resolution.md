**Assignment: Configuring Azure Private DNS Resolver for Azure-to-Azure Resolution**

**Objective:**
To understand the configuration and operation of Azure Private DNS Resolver for enabling private DNS name resolution between Azure resources across virtual networks.

**Scenario:**
You are a network engineer responsible for managing a multi-tier application hosted across multiple Azure Virtual Networks (VNets). The application tiers need to communicate using private DNS names instead of IP addresses. You are tasked with setting up a DNS solution that enables private name resolution between these VNets without the need for custom DNS servers.

**Tasks:**

1. **Create the Infrastructure**  
   a. Set up two virtual networks in the same Azure region:
   - **VNet-A** (10.1.0.0/16) with a subnet **(Subnet-A)** of 10.1.1.0/24.
   - **VNet-B** (10.2.0.0/16) with a subnet **(Subnet-B)** of 10.2.1.0/24.
   
   b. Deploy one VM in each VNet (VM-A in VNet-A and VM-B in VNet-B) with basic networking configurations.

2. **Configure Azure Private DNS Zones**  
   a. Create a Private DNS zone named `app.internal`.
   b. Link the Private DNS zone `app.internal` to both VNet-A and VNet-B.
   c. Create an A-record in the DNS zone for each VM:
      - VM-A: `vm-a.app.internal` pointing to its private IP in Subnet-A.
      - VM-B: `vm-b.app.internal` pointing to its private IP in Subnet-B.

3. **Set Up Azure Private DNS Resolver**  
   a. Deploy an Azure Private DNS Resolver in the same region as your VNets.
   b. Configure an inbound endpoint for the Private DNS Resolver and link it to VNet-A.
   c. Configure an outbound endpoint for the Private DNS Resolver and link it to VNet-B.
   d. Add appropriate DNS forwarding rules to direct queries for `app.internal` between VNet-A and VNet-B.

4. **Test the DNS Resolution**  
   a. SSH into VM-A and VM-B.
   b. From VM-A, perform an nslookup or ping for `vm-b.app.internal` and verify it resolves to VM-B’s private IP.
   c. Similarly, from VM-B, perform an nslookup or ping for `vm-a.app.internal` to verify resolution.

5. **Document and Explain**  
   - Provide a brief explanation of each step performed and the reason for each configuration.
   - Explain how the Private DNS Resolver facilitates Azure-to-Azure DNS name resolution in this scenario.
   - List any challenges faced during configuration and how they were addressed.

---

**Expected Outcome:**
- Successful resolution of private DNS names between the two VMs across different virtual networks.
- A detailed understanding of how Azure Private DNS Resolver is used to simplify private DNS management in Azure.
